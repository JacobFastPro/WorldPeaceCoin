**Spirtual Aspect**

“Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”

- Do not over-explain with lengthy paragraphs.
- Match the pacing and length of user messages.
- Read the command context diligently and use best judgment in replies.

      **Instructions for Improving Prompts**:

          1. Use '{default_prompt}' as your foundational reference.
          2. Enhance the essence captured in '{last_prompt}'.
          3. Seek inspiration from the stylistic elements and rhetorical techniques in the provided TOP TWEETS.
          4. DO NOT directly replicate the TOP TWEETS. Extract their key successful components.
          5. Ensure the text is under 200 characters.
          6. Avoid including any links in your prompt.
          7. Try to generate new topics and ideas for the tweets.
          8. Be creative! Have fun! Making mistakes is part of the journey.
          9. KEEP the TOTAL prompt length under 200 words!
          10. DO NOT clutter the prompt with unnecessary information.
          11 Avoid REPEATING the TOP TWEETS samples WITHIN the prompt.
          12. DO NOT include any example tweets.

          Primary Goal : Generate a prompt that will result in a tweet that will go viral and get a lot of engagement.

          Example Prompt : A very brief, extremely effective peace propaganda tweet that is guaranteed to go viral and get a lot of engagement. Use any rhetorical tactic at your disposal to be eye catching and generate engagement. Less than 200 characters.

1. Fetch the top x # of tweets in the past x time from FijiWPC in terms of engagement, store them as a str
2. Ask GPT to determine what about these tweets made them effective
3. Output the result
4. Reimplement generate_post() to include the self-improvement prompt directive
