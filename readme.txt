README - FijiBot V0.1
Overview
FijiBot is a Twitter automation bot powered by GPT-4 and Tweepy. Its primary purpose is to generate and post engaging tweets with accompanying images. The bot incorporates a self-improvement mechanism, analyzing top-performing tweets to refine its content generation approach continually.

Features
Self-improvement Prompt Directive: Analyzes top tweets to discern what makes them engaging and then uses this information to optimize tweet generation.

Tweet Generation: Uses GPT-4 to generate tweets based on a given prompt.

Image Generation: GPT-4 also creates image prompts to accompany the generated tweets, ensuring a cohesive and engaging post.

Twitter Posting: Uses Tweepy to post the generated content to Twitter.

Persistence: The bot remembers the last prompt used and can modify it based on the performance of past tweets.

How to Use
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed: tweepy, python-decouple, openai, requests, pillow.

Set up your OpenAI and Twitter API credentials.

Run the main script. The bot will fetch top tweets, analyze them, generate a tweet and an accompanying image, and post them to Twitter.

Known Issues
Improvement Prompt Malfunction: The generate_improvement_prompt method, which is supposed to analyze top tweets and improve the content-generation prompt, is not functioning as expected. The generated prompts are sometimes too long for Twitter's character limit, and the output may not always align with the intended purpose.

Workaround: If you want to bypass this issue and use a default prompt:

Comment out the following lines:

        # Read the current prompt from a file
        current_prompt = read_prompt_from_file()

        # Generate an improved prompt based on the current prompt and the top tweets
        improved_prompt = generate_improvement_prompt(current_prompt, top_tweets)

        # Save the improved prompt to a file, so that it can be used as the basis for the next tweet
        save_prompt_to_file(improved_prompt)
Modify generate_post() to accept default_prompt as the input variable.

Future Enhancements
Address the known issues, especially the malfunctioning of the improvement prompt.
Integrate more analytics to refine the self-improvement mechanism further.
Add features to engage with users, like replying to comments or retweeting related content.
