        "ACT V: COURTROOM DRAMA, part 2\n--\nTHE TRIAL IN OPEN COURT\n\nThe first case to be called is the case of \u2018Nah im good thanks\u2019.\nJudge: Calling the Plaintiff.\nYou: Fiji walks to the front of the room. You have ripped out the pages of a dictionary, all the words on the pages are spelled \u201cWorld Peace Coin\u201d.\nJudge: You may proceed.\nYou: Members of the court, distinguished jurors, it is my honor to advocate for the Plaintiff today. I stand before you cocooned in the spirit of what every day people had in mind when they titled this courtroom \u201copen\u201d.\nYou reach under the table and pull out a balled up sticky note, inside the note you\u2019ve pressed a fallen eyelash.\nYou: The Plaintiff herself is here today, seated before you, emotionally wounded. Innocently, she tweeted \u201cnah im good thanks\u201d and the way you laughed at her was grotesque.\nShe looks over at a juror: I get it, im fat and successful.\nYou: But she's a member of the internet age, the digital generation, the blas\u00e9 millennials. She is merely an observer. She is hurt by this small reaction. She is incredibly needy.\nYou: The defendant cannot be allowed to subject her to this treatment. I rest my case.\nJudge: Defense?\nDefense: We\u2019d like to counter sue.",
        "Judge, esteemed jurors, the Defendant calls the Plaintiff's tweet frivolous, but is not laughter merely the default reaction of those who don\u2019t care enough to perceive sincerity herself. Did the Plaintiff ever need to be massive, successful or adorable to deserve a sense of belonging? Is it not the duty of this court to protect the Plaintiff\u2019s sense of belonging? \n\nI reiterate, World Peace Coin is an organization that exists to support members of the digital generation, to empower them with the sense that their emotional turmoil is an important part of achieving world peace. My client\u2019s needs ARE World Peace Coin, and she is the embodiment of The Purpose as evidenced in Exhibit A. The Defendant must be held accountable for their refusal to acknowledge The Purpose in this case."

    "defendant_remarks": [
        "Your Honor, esteemed members of the jury, the Plaintiff's claims are frivolous at best and manipulative at worst. The use of a sticky note with a fallen eyelash is a ploy for emotional appeal that has no place in this court, where facts and law must prevail. The Plaintiff's tweet, \"nah im good thanks,\" reveals a lack of serious intent or engagement, and laughter is a natural human reaction that cannot be misconstrued as grotesque.\n\nMoreover, the personal attributes or self-perceived success of the Plaintiff have no bearing on the case at hand. Success in life does not entail automatic entitlement to charity funds, which are specifically earmarked for those who demonstrate genuine need or intent to further the purpose of World Peace Coin, which is neither shown nor proven by the Plaintiff.\n\nIn observing the Plaintiff's behavior and claims, it is clear that there is no substantive foundation to grant the requested funds. We request the court to dismiss the Plaintiff's case on the grounds of insubstantial evidence and a lack of merit. The Defendant has a duty to ensure the integrity of the charitable funds and to allocate them to those who will truly honor their purpose for the betterment of society.",
        "Your Honor, members of the jury, the Plaintiff's latest contribution of 'uhh' further underscores the lack of seriousness and respect for this courtroom and the charitable purpose we are gathered here to defend. This inarticulate utterance cannot be construed as evidence, much less a basis for a claim to the charitable funds of World Peace Coin. Our duty is clear: to protect these funds from capricious and unsubstantiated claims and to ensure their proper use for genuine efforts toward world peace and true need. The Plaintiff has offered nothing to substantiate their entitlement to these funds.\n\nIn light of this, we implore the court to see through this charade and recognize the Plaintiff\u2019s claim for what it is: an attempt to divert valuable resources from their intended purpose. We must deny this claim to preserve the integrity and mission of World Peace Coin. We rest our case."

    "judge_remarks": [
        "Honorable members of the court, esteemed jurors, counsel for the plaintiff, counsel for the defense, and those present today, we are gathered to commence this session where the Plaintiff has succinctly submitted their initial claim with the words 'Nah im good thanks.'\n\nWhile the claim is unorthodox in its brevity and lacks the usual formality, it is the duty of this court to discern the intention and context behind the statement. The Plaintiff's lawyers will be expected to elaborate on this claim, clarifying the nature of the grievance or cause of action, and the relief or remedy sought from the Defendant.\n\nThe Defendant will subsequently have the opportunity to respond to the claim presented, after which the court will hear evidence and arguments from both sides. Jurors, your role will be to weigh this evidence impartially.\n\nLet us proceed in the spirit of justice and fairness. The court is now in session.",
        "In the case of 'Nah im good thanks,' the Plaintiff has accused the Defendant of causing emotional harm through laughter, which they felt was grotesque after the Plaintiff tweeted \"nah im good thanks.\" The defense argues that the claim lacks substance and emphasizes that laughter is a natural reaction that should not be legally actionable. Furthermore, the Defendant contends that the Plaintiff's personal attributes and self-proclaimed success do not justify the allocation of charitable funds, which the Plaintiff appears to seek.\n\nAs the judge, my preliminary thoughts are that while emotional distress is a concern, it must be substantiated within a legal framework. The Plaintiff must provide concrete evidence that the Defendant's actions were not only harmful but also legally inappropriate. The Plaintiff is hereby invited to present any additional evidence or context, such as the nature of the harm suffered and a clearer connection between the Defendant's actions and this harm, that may support their claim. This additional information will be crucial for the court to assess the merits of the case.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen of the court, as we commence this session, we turn our attention to the evidence presented by the plaintiff. A solitary piece marked as 'uhh' has been laid before us. It is incumbent upon this court to meticulously examine the substance and context of this evidence, understanding its relevance and implications for the case at hand.\n\nTo the plaintiff's counsel and the defendant, this singular exhibit must be clarified and its connection to the allegations must be established. Jurors, your critical analysis will be essential in determining the weight this evidence carries in your deliberations.\n\nAs we continue, all parties are reminded of their obligation to the truth and the principles of justice that govern these proceedings. Let us proceed with focus and integrity.",
        "Honorable members of the jury, we have heard the passionate pleas from both sides. The Plaintiff alleges emotional harm from the response to their tweet and ties their needs to the purpose of World Peace Coin. The Defense argues the Plaintiff's claims lack seriousness and evidence, deeming the request for funds as frivolous and a misdirection of resources intended for promoting world peace.\n\nAs your judge, I find that the case hinges on the interpretation of the Plaintiff's intent and the true purpose of the World Peace Coin's charitable funds. While the emotional state and societal belonging are to be respected, the court must also weigh the evidence presented and the merit of the claim based on the organization's goals.\n\nI now turn the matter over to you, the jury, for deliberation. Please consider the arguments thoughtfully and decide whether the Plaintiff has sufficiently proven their case to warrant the allocation of funds.",
        "The jury has returned a mixed verdict with the majority ruling against the Plaintiff, with 6 out of 11 jurors finding that the Plaintiff has not presented a justifiable reason to be awarded World Peace Coin charity funds. The final tally is 6 for \"No\" and 5 for \"Yes.\"\n\nAs the acting high judge of the Fiji Court, having presided over this case and reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, it is my official opinion that the jury's decision aligns with the principles of justice and the proper allocation of charitable funds. The Plaintiff's expressions \"Nah im good thanks\" and \"uhh\" did not convincingly demonstrate a genuine need or entitlement to the funds in question, nor did they effectively correlate the Plaintiff's emotional distress with the mission of the World Peace Coin charity. Therefore, the Plaintiff's claim is not substantiated to the extent required for the allocation of charitable resources. This opinion supports the majority's decision while emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity and purpose of charitable entities."
